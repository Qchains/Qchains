# QChains.io

**QChains** is a next-generation blockchain infrastructure designed by **Q@qchains.io** (Dr. Josef Kurk Edwards) that replaces traditional mining with promise-based consensus logic. It reimagines distributed trust using async Promise chaining (`Promise.then()`) and secure, identity-bound block creation.

> “Every block is a promise. Every promise is a race. Every race ends with truth.” – QChains Design Ethos

## Overview

QChains introduces a radical new consensus model:

- No mining. No staking.
- Identity-authenticated *Promises* become block generators.
- A Promise is a cryptographic object validated by QTime and finalized through *async truth loops*.
- Built for **Google Cloud**, **Kubernetes**, and **secure ledger-bound identity integration**.
- Launches with `.Q`-suffixed wallet addresses (e.g., `QAQ`) and a fully functional devnet.

## Key Features

- **Promise Logic Consensus**  
  Replaces PoW/PoS with JavaScript-style chained promise resolution in distributed validators.

- **QTime Anchoring**  
  Each Promise must resolve within a dynamic epoch range, enforced by time-based hash targeting.

- **Human-Led Identity Binding**  
  Wallets are linked to KYC-verified identities (with opt-in privacy masking). AI governance handles QBlock approval logic.

- **Smart Contract Layer**  
  Promise contracts are compiled to `qll` (QLogic Language), a simplified VM-safe async bytecode.

- **Kubernetes Native**  
  GitHub Actions + Kustomize-powered deployments, designed for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
