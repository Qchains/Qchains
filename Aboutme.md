# An Expert Analysis of Quantum Blockchains Inc.

## I. Executive Summary

**Quantum Blockchains Inc. (QBCI)** pioneers **quantum-safe cryptography** and **quantum-secure blockchain infrastructure**. Amid rising threats from quantum computing, QBCI offers a dual-front defense: advancing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) systems and securing blockchains through its patented **post-Quantum Key Distribution (pQKD)** and **Quantum Secured Blockchain (QSB)** network.

Core technologies include:
- **pQKD**: Emulates QKD using PQC algorithms and quantum entropy sources.
- **QRNG & Entropy-as-a-Service**: Multi-source, high-quality quantum randomness.
- **QSB**: Layered blockchain architecture fortified with QKD, PQC, and QRNG.

QBCI directly addresses "harvest now, decrypt later" threats and positions itself to serve high-security sectors like finance, healthcare, and government.

## II. The Impending Quantum Threat

Quantum computers threaten RSA, ECC, and blockchain consensus/security mechanisms via:
- **Shor’s Algorithm** (efficient prime factorization)
- **Breakdown of public-key encryption and digital signatures**

> **Blockchain systems are highly vulnerable** due to their reliance on cryptographic primitives.

QBCI counters this with:
- pQKD-based key distribution
- PQC-compliant digital signatures
- Quantum-grade entropy via QRNG
